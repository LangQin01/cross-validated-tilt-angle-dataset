# Mutually Validated Tilt Angle Dataset
This dataset provides reliable sunspot group/active region(AR) tilt angle data and several other parameters from 1996 to 2018.

# Overview
The dataset is generated by mutually validating two existing datasets: (1) **A-live-homogeneous-database-of-solar-active-regions** by Ruihui Wang, Jie Jiang and Yukun Luo (**WJL**), and (2) **Debrecen Photoheliographic Data sunspot catalogue** 
by Baranyi, T., Győri, L. and Ludmány, A. (**DPD**). The original datasets can be downloaded via their websites: 
[A-live-homogeneous-database-of-solar-active-regions](https://github.com/Wang-Ruihui/A-live-homogeneous-database-of-solar-active-regions) and [Debrecen Photoheliographic Data](http://fenyi.solarobs.epss.hun-ren.hu/en/databases/DPD/)

The mutual validation is automatically accomplished by Python. The code, **mutual_validation.py**, is attached. For a more detailed description of the mutual validation method, see Lang Qin, Jie Jiang, Ruihui Wang, Mutual Validation of Datasets for Analyzing Tilt Angles in Solar Active Regions(APJ under review)

# Data Description
The mutually validated datset is in the file **mutually_validated_tilt_angle_dataset.xlsx**. There are 14 columns, each contains a type of parameter. The meanings of each header are as follows:

> date_dpd: date of observation in DPD dataset
>
> lat_dpd: heliographic latitude of the sunspot group
>
> lon_dpd: (Carrington) heliographic longitude of the sunspot group
>
> area_dpd: the total area of the sunspot group in $\mu MSH$
>
> tilt_dpd: the tilt angle of the sunspot group
>
> date_wjl: date of observation in WJL dataset
>
> lat_wjl: heliographic latitude of the active region
>
> lon_wjl: (Carrington) heliographic longitude of the active region
>
> area_wjl: the total area of the active region in $\mu MSH$
>
> flux_wjl: the total unsigned magnetic flux of the active region in Mx
>
> tilt_wjl: the tilt angle of the active region
>
> number: the NOAA number
>
> CR: the Carrington rotation number of the sunspot group/active region
>
> consistency: the marker of whether the two tilt angle values are close enough to be considered consistent. "1" means consistent and "0" means inconsistent
